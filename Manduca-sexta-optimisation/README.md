## Manduca Sexta Project

Manduca sexta is a worm. A tobacco hornworm. Our job will be to get Manduca to move. In this homework, we used Simulated Annealing (SA) to explore how to make Manduca cover more ground (larger distance) in a given amount of time by deciding on which legs to lock, which muscles to activate, and the timing of both of these using the algorithm. We will assume this time period is the gait pattern over a period of 100 seconds. In order to simplify things, we assumed that each leg of a pair acts in synchrony with its partner. In other words, we need only control 5 “legs” (each of which is really a leg pair) rather than 10; and 4 muscles between each leg.
